# SH_Tully
We share our own implementation of the trajectory surface hopping method based on Tully's approach using the velocity Verlet algorithm.
This implementation works as a pluging of [PySurf](https://github.com/MFSJMenger/pysurf) which is a software framework for data science applications in computational chemistry.
