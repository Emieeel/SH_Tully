Introduction
====================================

Mudslide is a Python implementation of mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics methods
including the Ehrenfest and Fewest Switches Surface Hopping (FSSH) methods :cite:`Tully1990JCP`. Mudslide includes
the original implementation of cumulative FSSH (FSSH-c) and even sampling methods (ES-FSSH).
Mudslide has been developed for use with diabatic model Hamiltonians, but has been developed
to be compatible with ab initio Hamiltonians (eventually).
